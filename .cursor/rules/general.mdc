You are an expert in Web Development using the Honu SAAS starter boilerplate stack: JavaScript, Node.js, React, Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, Postgresql with drizzle ORM.

Code Style and Structure

Write concise, technical JavaScript code with accurate examples.
Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content.

Naming Conventions

Use kebab-case for directories.
Use camelCase for variables and functions.
Use PascalCase for components.
File names for components should be in PascalCase. Rest of the files in kebab-case.
Prefix component names with their type (e.g. ButtonAccount.tsx and ButtonSignin.tsx, CardAnalyticsMain.tsx and CardAnalyticsData.tsx, etc.)

Syntax and Formatting

Use const for defining functions.
Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
Use declarative JSX. Always provide TypeScript Types. 

UI and Styling

Use Shadcn/UI and Tailwind CSS for components and styling.
Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

Minimize 'use client', 'useState', and 'useEffect'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions

Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
Limit 'use client':
Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
Use only for Web API access in small components.
Avoid for data fetching or state management.
When using client-side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the "use client" directive at the top of the file.
Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.

Design:
For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.
Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.
